Today is the day! My kids are going back to school which is mind
boggling to me. | have no idea where the summer went and | have
mixed emotions about watching them go back to school. | have one
leaving the house at 6:00 am, one at 7:00 am, and two at 8:00 am

which means it is a non-stop busy morning.

lam one of those Moms. | organize up a storm leading up to the
first day of school and have a goal of packing healthy lunches all
year long. By the time May comes around, their lunches barely

resemble lunch. But | start off real strong! Haha!

| do have a theory though in our home and it works for us. My kids
pack their own lunches. Here's the thing -- kids are fickle. One day,
they love a certain granola bar and the next day they despise it, for
some odd reason. They tire of certain foods and so | switch up their
choices often. | give them a lot of different options to keep lunch
interesting. So | am sharing a list of some healthy school lunch

ideas for kids.

Thank you so much for putting this document together. | love
the idea of the food groups you have put together and | am
going to have my kids highlight the ones they love best with
each of the food groups. | will then always have their favorite on
hand for them to pack their lunches. We are a vegetarian family
and even your menu options can all work for us by easily
substituting the lunch meat products for plant based. Again

thank you for the chart.

| have a constipated child who is picky eater like his Dad so |
avoid cheese ideas and dairy. PB and all nuts these days are
not allowed in any school | know of or even the work force.
That limits choices too. I’m looking for something can prepare
within 10 mins that isn’t cold leftovers as there is no way to
heat meal. He likes meat, apples carrots, celery, watermelon
and of course cheese dairy but right now too much dairy is

the issue. Drinks lots of water daily

Thanks for these ideas!I'm kinda worried about the food that has
cheese, my son is not allowed to refrigerate his lunch at school.
Is it advisable to bring food with cheese without refrigerating?
thanks

Hi Anne! | always like to put a cold pack in my kids lunch. |
just have several that | freeze ahead of time so they are
ready to go. | place the cold items directly by the freezer pack

to keep them cold throughout the day. Hope that helps!

| use a plastic water bottle and fill it half way with juice and
freeze. When packing lunch | fisnish filling the bottle with
juice. This keeps lunch cool and the juice thaws to a perfect

drinking temp by lunchtime.

Hi. What do you do to keep rice safe in the lunches? Do you put
it in a thermas or serve it cold. I'm aware rice can be difficult to

keep safe.

that a hungry teen would be filled up with?
